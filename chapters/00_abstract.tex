\chapter*{Abstract}

% intro, problem
News media is the way that we get informed about information every day.
We read news to know what happens and when we do that, not only we receive the facts, but also the interpretation of the writer, that can be distinguished with different degrees of difficulty.
This phenomenon is called \emph{framing} and different works have analysed it.

% niche
With this PhD, we want to tackle instances of framing that are difficult to recognise, and manifest subtly through word choices and selection of what to include or exclude from the narrative line.

% contributions
We present a method that could help both human readers and automated approaches to find more easily when such framing techniques occur in the news.
We want to provide an analysis on articles, by exploiting the differences of how information is presented by different sources, and analyse how different sources in the media landscape are using framing in different ways.
